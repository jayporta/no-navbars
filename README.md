### WIP as of June 25, 2021

Remember frames? That column on the left of a web page that was used for page navigation? They're dead.

You know nav bars? That bar on the top of a web page that's used for page navigation? They're boring.

This site has no nav bar.

Also I need an excuse to prove to potential employers that I can build React sites with Redux, React Router, and theming. I've been a frontend dev since late-2016 but don't have much publicly available code to show for it. That's what happens when all the work you've done has been B2B and you never have time for open source or side projects).

Since this is my personal project I'm building this my way (hmf!):

JavaScript Standard because it supports my decision to [not use semicolons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qlr-FGbhKaI). If anything breaks because of a missing semicolon, consider it a win for Team Semicolon.

A different way of organizing files so there's less digging through nested directories.
