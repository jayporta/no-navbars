Remember frames? That column on the left of a web page that was used for page navigation? It died.

You know nav bars? That bar on the top of a web page that's used for page navigation? It's boring.

This page has no nav bar.

Also I need an excuse to prove that I can build React sites with Redux and React Router. But I'm doing it my way with JavaScript Standard because it offers me freedom from semicolons. If anything breaks because of a missing semicolon, consider it a win for Team Semicolon.
